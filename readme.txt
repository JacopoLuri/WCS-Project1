What was the idea behind this project ..?

The idea was created from our passion for cars, history and the environment.
It all blended together and decided to create something that would be creative and fun, but also something that  would point out the need of solutions and innovation in a world that is rapidly changing, impacting the environment surrounding us.
We had a lot of ideas that we managed to write down. We created some wireframes that would shape these ideas and give us the workflow we needed.
